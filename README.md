The Contact Manager application is a web-based system developed using ASP.NET Core MVC, Entity Framework Core, and Microsoft SQL Server. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern can be used to create a structured, maintainable, and fully functional web application.

This application allows users to manage contact information by adding, editing, viewing, and deleting contacts stored in a SQL Server database. Through this project, important concepts such as MVC architecture, database integration with SQL Server, data validation, and CRUD operations were applied in a real-world scenario.
